    "In this report, we will use a real-world dataset, specifically on Airbnb listings in Amsterdam, Athens, and Berlin in 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides a comprehensive look at Airbnb prices in some of the most popular European cities. Each listing is evaluated for various attributes to capture an in-depth understanding of Airbnb prices on both weekdays and weekends. This data set can offer insight into how global markets are affected by social dynamics and geographical factors which, in turn, determine pricing strategies for optimal profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to answer two distinct questions regarding Superhost status on Airbnb:\n",
    "\n",
    "What factors are most associated with a host's Superhost status?\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Superhost status influence the cost of a rental?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: What factors are most associated with a host's Superhost status?\n",
    "Although Airbnb does directly state the requirements of a Superhost as (Airbnb, n.d):\n",
    "\n",
    "Host at least 100 nights across 10 or more unique reservations\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain a response rate of at least 90%\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain a cancellation rate at or below 1% with the exception of valid reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain a rating of at least 4.8 out of 5\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth investigating what additional factors influence Superhost status. For example, perhaps certain cities or attraction indexes influence the demographic of guests that book the property, impacting the host's ability to achieve the requirements listed above. This analysis aims to identify these additional hidden factors that are statistically and practically associated with one's Superhost status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it can be a tool for travelers to compare standards more uniformly across different regions. If the Superhost status is dramatically higher due to a particular criterion, then it could potentially indicate that it isn't worth spending significantly more on the property versus non-Superhost properties if that criterion isn't a priority for them. This can allow guests to make more informed purchasing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: How does Superhost status influence the cost of a rental?\n",
    "It is cited that guests seem to be willing to pay more for Superhost accommodations in Hong Kong (Liang, 2017). Does this also apply across European cities, making the trend more rigorously revalidated and universal? If so, how much more are guests willing to pay? Is the difference statistically and/or practically significant? How does the distribution of rental price compare between hosts of either status (for example, do the top 5% of non-Superhosts make more than the average Superhost)? Which strata see the most improvement by acquiring a Superhost badge? The goal of this analysis is to conclude a comprehensive analysis and understanding of what most hosts can expect to gain by becoming a Superhost."
